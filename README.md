# Food Order System (Term Project)

A web-based food ordering system for restaurants, built with PHP, JavaScript, MySQL, and CSS. The system allows customers to browse menus, place orders, and track their order status.

### Collaboration
This project was developed collaboratively by Panyarat and Pornkamol. We worked together to implement the features and improve the overall design and functionality.

### Features
- **Browse Menus**: Customers can view available food items.
- **Place Orders**: Add food to the cart and complete the order.
- **Order Tracking**: Real-time updates on order status (e.g., "In Progress", "Completed").
- **Admin Panel**: Restaurant managers can manage orders, update menus, and view order history.
